While the stdlib modules, the pywin32 extensions and any individual
third-party packages tend to address one particular area of Windows
development, you may well need to use more than one of them, or to
choose between them according to various factors. This section of
the documentation is organised into broad sections based on probable
areas of interest when developing under Windows. Each section can
then indicate what modules and techniques can be of use in this area,
and what the pros and cons are of each one, illustrated by useful and
self-contained examples.
