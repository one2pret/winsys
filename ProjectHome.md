WinSys is a Python package which wraps aspects of the Windows API to make them more Pythonic and usable by Windows administrators directly from the interpreter or as part of a wider set of applications. It targets recent versions of Python and reasonably recent versions of Windows although itâ€™s not yet up speed on Vista & x64.

It is unashamedly platform-specific: no hint of a concession towards more Unix-like operating systems. You can read about the design philosophy and decisions in <a href='http://timgolden.me.uk/python/winsys/about.html#about-winsys'>About WinSys</a>. If you want to see some examples, have a look in the <a href='http://timgolden.me.uk/python/winsys/cookbook.html#cookbook'>Cookbook</a>.
