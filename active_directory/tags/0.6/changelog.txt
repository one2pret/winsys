                   Added .dump method to AD_object to allow easy viewing
                    of all fields.
                   Allowed find_user / find_computer to have default values,
                    meaning the logged-on user and current machine.
                   Added license: PSF

                     (see AD_object.__setattr__)
                   Added module-level functions:
                     root - returns a default AD instance
                     search - calls root's search
                     find_user - returns first match for a user/fullname
                     find_computer - returns first match for a computer
